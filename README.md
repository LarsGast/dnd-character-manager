## About

The LarsGast DnD Character Manager is a website where D&D players can manage the characters they play as in campaigns. On this page, you can store multiple characters (no limit currently), define their statistics and features with the same freedom as pen and paper (including homebrew), and easily access the end result for in-game use.

This application seeks to act as a replacement to physical character sheets while still maintaining the freedom and ease of use these physical sheets provide.

## Why this project?

Players often rely on fragile paper sheets that can tear, become unreadable, or be hard to search in during a session. This project provides a fast, privacy-friendly, local-first character manager optimized for live gameplay — quick access to skill modifiers, saves, spells, inventory, and homebrew options.

While other solutions like D&D Beyond already offer comprehensive character managers, we have often found these interfaces cluttered and characters are often too strictly bound to the core rules. DnD is a game of creativity and homebrew, which players should easily be able to express on their digital character sheet, just like on paper.

This project also includes features missing from other character managers, like easily adding homebrew and being able to find how stat modifiers are built up.

## Privacy & security
- By default all data is stored locally in the browser (localStorage).
    - This prevents anyone (even us) to access your data.
- You can export all data that is stored on the page.
    - Save backups, move data between browsers/ devices, do whatever you want with it.
